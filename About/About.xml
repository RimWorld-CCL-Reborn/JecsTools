  <description>1.1.0.12 (11-03-2018)

Adds modding components to RimWorld: vehicles, spell casting, weapon slots, oversized weapons, and more!

Note to players: This mod will not change your game, but rather it lets modders do more, so you can have an even more amazing RimWorld experience.

Note to modders: This mod is filled with lots of tools that allow you to do many new and different things in RimWorld. Check out RoxxPloxx's guide for more info here: https://github.com/roxxploxx/RimWorldModGuide/wiki

Partial list of components:

CompDeflector
 - Allows the ability to knock projectiles to melee weapons.

CompExtraSounds
